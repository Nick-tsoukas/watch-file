# watch-file

This could be an idea for a somewhat fun and useful app idea but currently it is nothing

This is a useless repo, but I wanted to practice building a simple layout in html and use the node.js fs module to log out every time I changed the file and count how many times the file was changed.

What I noticed was that the fs module runs every time you hit the save button in vs code. I'm wonding why. A better way to do this would be to compare the index.html to the latest version and see if there were any differences. That way you would really know how make times you tried to load your layout until you get the right one.

As a challenge, I think it would be interesting to tally up how many time a developer would need to make changes to a layout in order to reach his goal.
